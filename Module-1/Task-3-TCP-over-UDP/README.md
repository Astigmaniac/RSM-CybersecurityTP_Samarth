# Task 3: TCP-like Protocol over UDP( I hate this as much as I love it)
This project implements a simplified TCP-like protocol using UDP sockets in C.

The goal is to understand how TCP provides reliable communication by implementing
its core mechanisms at the application layer.
- Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Sequenced data transfer
